		<h3>Giving</h3>
		<p>At Harvest Connexion, we believe that giving of our first fruits is an act of worship and a way that we can
			honor God with what He has given us. God has greatly increased the effectiveness of church through your
			gifts and faithfulness. We have an opportunity, as at no other time in history, to transform our world
			through God's Word, one life at a time.</p>
		<p>Your tithes and gifts are vital to the everyday ministry that takes place in and through Harvest Connexion.
			Thank you for your faithful support as you prayerfully consider how God is leading you to give.</p>

		<h3>It's secure</h3>
		<p>Online giving is actually more secure than checks or cash. With this system, you won't have three or four
			different people processing your paper checks or cash. Your gift is electronically transferred directly to
			our bank and the information about your transfer is sent to our office for our internal records.</p>
