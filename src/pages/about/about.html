		<h1>Our Story</h1>
		<p>YESTERDAY</p>
		<p>Harvest was founded by Pastor Paul Cypert on Father's Day, 1988 in Plainview, Texas. Pastor Paul had a dream
			from God of a church full of people young at heart worshipping Jesus. Paul and D'Ann started the church as a
			Life Group with a few friends, and their families, that met in their home. The pioneering days of Harvest
			consisted of constant prayer, worship, fellowship and a lot of hard work.</p>
		<p>TODAY</p>
		<p>The heart of Harvest has always been to reach people with the message of Jesus Christ. What started out as a
			Life Group in Pastor Paul's living room has grown into what we like to call a life-giving, bible preaching,
			Christ manifesting, Spirit-filled church. Throughout the years, we have trained up leaders and sent them out
			to plant other Harvest churches and campuses. Currently, Harvest ministers to over 2,000 people every Sunday
			at our three campuses. Over the years we have also worked with international ministries to share the love
			and Word of God with people in Africa, Poland, Bulgaria and Mexico.</p>
		<p>TOMORROW</p>
		<p>The campuses we have in Plainview, Lubbock, and Amarillo represent what we believe God is calling us to do in
			future. We intend to plant additional campuses across this region. We will continue to minister to the
			people of Mexico through annual ministry trips and we will always be a place where people can come to
			worship Jesus with all of their heart, mind, soul, and strength.</p>
		<p>TOGETHER</p>
		<p>At Harvest we recognize that God has a plan and purpose for each person's life. We believe He's created us to
			live together in a healthy, life-giving community of believers called the local church. Put simply, Harvest
			is a church that is about reaching people right where they're at. We're a church on a mission to the culture
			with the message of Jesus. You play an important part in being light to your sphere of influence. Together,
			we can advance the vision God has given us and continue making a difference right here in our community.</p>
